### Quizzical

This is a tiny quiz app built with React as a part of the React Basics Course on Scrimba. I built this as a review for React, so nothing super fancy here. Some minor tweaks to the design, but on the whole I've kept it pretty faithful to the original.

Some features of the app:

- Fetch API
- Using Vite
- Using a loading animation
